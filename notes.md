-   make the graph drag and move, and generate graph when moved to new area
-   imporve the ui
-   show value of coordinates(4) on hover on arrow
-   Make particle animation
    -   consider it as a velocity field
    -   convert it into stream a plot
    -   instead of plotting the function, plot it's conjugate (Polya vector field)
    -   Polya vector field -> physical flow -> Inviscid, Incompressible, Irrotational flow
